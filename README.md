# Mutual Fund Returns Tracker

A simple web app to track mutual fund returns across multiple timeframes in a single, sortable table. Built to fill the gap left by most platforms, which only show daily changes or long-term charts, but not a consolidated view.

## Features
- Fetches NAV data directly from the public [MFAPI](https://api.mfapi.in)
- Clean, minimal UI with sortable columns for different return periods
- Batch file (`start-mf-tracker.bat`) for one-click local setup and debugging
- Notes section for personal tracking
- Built using Python, Flask, and Bootstrap
- Developed rapidly using [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/) (LLM-powered IDE)

## Motivation
Most mutual fund platforms (like Coin) only show yesterday's change or long-term charts. I wanted a simple table to compare returns across timeframes for my own workflowâ€”so I built it. Sometimes, building your own tool is the most liberating way to solve a problem.
